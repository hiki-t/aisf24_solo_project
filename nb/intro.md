# Welcome to my AISF work

<br>

During Oct 2024 - Feb 2025,  
I am participating in the AI Safety Fundamentals (AISF) program, organised by the BlueDot Impact.

Particularly, I am taking the Alignment course (https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/alignment/).  

This course is composed of two phases: (1) the learning phase, and (2) the project phase.

(1) The learning phase is helpful for building fundamental knowledge in AI Safety (e.g. AI risks and misalignments, RLHF, Scalable oversight, AI model's robustness, model risks/capabilities evaluations) and developing further research questions during periods of 8 weeks.

(2) The project phase provides an opportunity to conduct an own project during periods of 4 weeks.

Below, I created resources of learning materials I used and the solo project I am completing:
